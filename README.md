# Sonic Garage

A Classic Sonic level editor fangame, very much inspired by Lapper's [Sonic Studio](https://sonicstudiofangame.weebly.com/information.html). Go play that once it's out, it'll absolutely be way better than this!

The `master` branch of this repo is likely to be even more unfinished and broken than it already is. For not-really-finished builds I'd somewhat recommend playing, see [the releases page](./releases)

(This is very unfinished, this repo mostly just exists so you can look at what I'm doing.)
